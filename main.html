    <p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0) " ; title="Information">Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, byname Vir or Veer, (born May 28,
        1883, Bhagur, India—died Feb. 26, 1966, Bombay [now Mumbai]), Hindu and Indian nationalist and leading figure in
        the Hindu Mahasabha (“Great Society of Hindus”), a Hindu nationalist organization and political party.</p>
    <hr>
    <p> While a student of law in London (1906–10), Savarkar helped to instruct a group of Indian revolutionaries in
        methods of sabotage and assassination that associates of his had apparently learned from expatriate Russian
        revolutionaries in Paris. During this period he wrote The Indian War of Independence, 1857 (1909), in which he
        took the view that the Indian Mutiny of 1857 was the first expression of Indian mass rebellion against British
        colonial rule.</p>
